<h1 style="margin-top:120px">COPULA CALCULATOR</h1>

<p class="emph">
This site is the final project for African American English, taught at New York University in Spring 2016 by Professor Ren√©e Blake. 
</p>

<h3> Background</h3>
<p>
Copula absence is a grammatical feature of African American English, denoted by absence of 'is' or 'are'. This feature is systematic and rule-governed: some copula forms can not be left out, and the absences that do occur are distributed in frequencies that are context-dependent.
</p>

<h3> Copula deletion features </h3>

<p class="emph">Absence</p>

<p>Copula forms</p>
<ul>
  <li>'are' and 'is' ("We (are) inside.") </li>
  <ul><li>Absence of 'are' is more common than 'is'</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>Absence can occur after</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pronoun ("he", "she", "they", "we")</li>
  <li>Noun ("Daniel", "people")</li>
  <li>Absence after Pronoun is more common than after Noun</li>
</ul>
<p>Absence can occur before</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most common absence occurs before present progressive of 'to go': 'gonna', 'going to', 'gon' ("She (is) gonna be here soon.")</li>
  <li>Adjective ("People (are) crazy.")</li>
  <li>Noun ("She (is) a writer.")</li>
  <li>Gerund: verb ending in -ing ("He (is) walking.")</li>
  <li>Locative: any preposition ("They (are) in the store.")</li>
  <li>Frequency is as follows (most to least likely): 'Gonna' > verb + ing > Adjective/Locative > Noun</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p class="emph">Obligatory Presence</p>
<ul>
<li>First person singular 'am' ("I _am_ walking.")</li>
<li>Past tense 'was' and 'were' ("She _was_ inside.")</li>
<li>Sentence-final ("I know that she _is_.")</li>
<li>Emphasized ("He _IS_ a teacher.")</li>
<li>Contracted 's ("She_'s_ happy.")</li>
<li>Contracted form ain't ("He _ain't_ allowed.")</li>
<li>Infinitive be ("She can _be_ a famous.")</li>
</ul>

Based on Rickford &amp; Rickford, Chapter 7 (2000).
<h3> Technical Details </h3>
<p>
  This project is built using the Flask web framework. The backend of the calculator is a Python script which uses the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit</a> library for part of speech tagging. 
</p>
<p>
  Tested the algorithm using text from The Piano Lesson by August Wilson. For test sentences and full text, check out the <a href="/example">example text</a>.

<h3> Algorithm Details </h3>
<p>
  How do we calculate copula presence in Copula Calculator version 1.0?
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get user input and tag all the parts of speech with NLTK library.</li>
  <li>Eliminate impossible cases: end of sentence, or first person.</li>
  <li>Looping through the sentence, check if word is a pronoun or noun. If so, check part of speech of the following word.</li>
  <li>If the next word is a copula ("is," "are"), increment copula presence count.</li>
  <li>Else, increment copula absence count.</li>
  <li>Pass counts to the printer, which displays total tally to the front end!</li>
</ol>
